# Buildings list

> **In short**: each planet can hold up to 17 buildings (plus 3 more on a moon). Mines produce resources, power plants produce energy, storage keeps your stock, and facilities unlock research, ships, defenses and missiles. Every building level takes one field on the planet.

> **Universe setting**: building speed may differ from one universe to another.
> Default: **×1** · Redline: **×1**
{.is-info}

## Rules

1. Buildings are built **level by level**. Each level costs more than the previous one.
2. **Each level takes one field** on the planet. Exceptions: the Planetary Base (one field, single level) and the Repair Station, which takes no field.
3. Buildings can **never be destroyed by an enemy**. Only their owner can demolish them (see [Demolishing a building](/en/economy/demolition)).
4. A building is **paid when its construction starts**, not when it is queued.
5. **Points**: each level is worth 1 point per 1,000 resources spent, counted as economy points.
6. Every building has a **maximum level**: going higher would unlock nothing.
7. The **Planetary Base** (Colonial Base on a colony) exists from the start, cannot be demolished, and provides base storage and a small fixed income.

## Worked example

Costs seen in game to raise the Mineral Excavator from level 13 to level 14:
- **11,677 metal and 2,919 crystal**, that is 14,596 resources, so **14.6 economy points**.
- Output rises from 1,346 to **1,594 metal/h**, and energy use from 448 to **531**.

### Costs seen in game

Cost of one given level, recorded on a planet in the Redline universe. Full level-by-level tables will be added to each building's own page.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mineral Excavator | 14 | 11,677 | 2,919 | 0 | |
| Crystal Extractor | 14 | 21,617 | 10,808 | 0 | |

**Energy required** is not consumed: the planet's energy output only has to reach that threshold when construction starts.

## Common pitfalls

- **Mines and energy go together**: every mine level uses more energy. Without enough power, all output slows down (see [Energy](/en/economy/energy)).
- **Fields are limited**: each level takes one. Think of the Planetary Modulator before your planet fills up.
- **A queued order is not paid yet**: it is paid when it starts. If the planet cannot afford it at that moment, the order is dropped at no cost.
- **Maximum levels**: there is no point trying to push the Innovation Center or the Orbital Dock beyond level 12, or the Automaton Factory beyond level 10.
