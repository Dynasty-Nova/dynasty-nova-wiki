# Planetary Modulator and Logistics Center

> **In short**: two buildings to push a planet further. The **Planetary Modulator** adds fields when the planet is full. The **Logistics Center** enlarges storage by 10% per level.

## Rules

### Planetary Modulator
1. Requirements: **Molecular Assembler 1** and **Energy Science 12**. Maximum level: 10.
2. Each level adds **5 fields**, plus **1 bonus field at even levels**. The Modulator itself takes one field per level: the net gain is 4 fields at odd levels and 5 at even levels.
3. Level 1 cost: **50,000 crystal and 100,000 hydrogen**, no metal. The cost doubles at each level.
4. It also has an **energy requirement** (1,000 at level 1, doubled at each level). It is not consumed: the planet's energy output only has to reach that threshold when construction starts.
5. A **full** planet always accepts a Modulator upgrade, since it is the only way to free up space.

### Logistics Center
6. Requirement: **Quantum Computing 2**. Maximum level: 10.
7. Each level enlarges storage by **10%**: +100% at level 10.
8. Level 1 cost: **20,000 metal and 40,000 crystal**. The cost doubles at each level.

## Worked example

**Planetary Modulator level 4** on a 163-field planet
- Fields added: 5 + 6 + 5 + 6 = **22**. The Modulator takes 4: **18 more fields** for your other buildings.
- Total cost of the 4 levels: 750,000 crystal and 1,500,000 hydrogen. Energy required to start level 4: 8,000.

**Logistics Center level 3** with an Alloy Depot at level 2 (40,000 capacity)
- Bonus: +30%, so 40,000 × 1.3 = **52,000**.

## Detailed data

### Planetary Modulator

| Level | Crystal | Hydrogen | Energy required | Fields added | Net gain | Total fields added |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 50,000 | 100,000 | 1,000 | +5 | +4 | 5 |
| 2 | 100,000 | 200,000 | 2,000 | +6 | +5 | 11 |
| 3 | 200,000 | 400,000 | 4,000 | +5 | +4 | 16 |
| 4 | 400,000 | 800,000 | 8,000 | +6 | +5 | 22 |
| 5 | 800,000 | 1,600,000 | 16,000 | +5 | +4 | 27 |
| 6 | 1,600,000 | 3,200,000 | 32,000 | +6 | +5 | 33 |
| 7 | 3,200,000 | 6,400,000 | 64,000 | +5 | +4 | 38 |
| 8 | 6,400,000 | 12,800,000 | 128,000 | +6 | +5 | 44 |
| 9 | 12,800,000 | 25,600,000 | 256,000 | +5 | +4 | 49 |
| 10 | 25,600,000 | 51,200,000 | 512,000 | +6 | +5 | 55 |

### Logistics Center

| Level | Metal | Crystal | Storage bonus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 20,000 | 40,000 | +10% |
| 2 | 40,000 | 80,000 | +20% |
| 3 | 80,000 | 160,000 | +30% |
| 4 | 160,000 | 320,000 | +40% |
| 5 | 320,000 | 640,000 | +50% |
| 6 | 640,000 | 1,280,000 | +60% |
| 7 | 1,280,000 | 2,560,000 | +70% |
| 8 | 2,560,000 | 5,120,000 | +80% |
| 9 | 5,120,000 | 10,240,000 | +90% |
| 10 | 10,240,000 | 20,480,000 | +100% |

## Common pitfalls

- **The Modulator mostly costs hydrogen**: 100,000 from level 1, then double at each level. A cold planet funds it more easily.
- **The energy requirement climbs fast**: 512,000 at level 10. Plan your power plants.
- **The Modulator takes space too**: count the net gain, not the fields added.
