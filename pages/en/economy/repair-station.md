# Repair Station

> **In short**: after a battle lost while defending, the Repair Station recovers part of your destroyed ships and gives them back repaired, after 30 minutes to 12 hours. The recovered share rises with its level. It takes no field.
{.is-info}

> **Universe setting**: the recovered share depends on the universe's debris rate, and repair time on its shipyard speed.
> Redline: debris **30%**, shipyard **×1**

## Rules

1. The Station only acts after a **battle lost while defending**.
2. It recovers a share of the destroyed ships: **share = level coefficient × (1 − debris rate)**. The coefficient goes from 45% at level 1 to 54% at level 10.
3. The share applies **to each ship type separately**, rounded down: a few losses may bring nothing back.
4. **There is no dice roll**: the share is fixed.
5. **Duration**: the Station repairs **10 structure points per second per level**, multiplied by the universe's shipyard speed. Duration is between **30 minutes and 12 hours**. All ships from the same battle come back together.
6. During repair, the ships are **away from the planet**: they do not defend, cannot be destroyed or plundered, and count neither in your fleets nor in your points. They come back intact.
7. A repair **cannot be cancelled**.
8. Recovered ships appear among **losses** in the battle report, with a note.
9. The Station **takes no field** and uses no energy while running; energy is only a threshold required to build it.
10. **Defenses** are not concerned: they have their own 70% repair (see [Defense rebuild](/en/combat/defense-rebuild)).

## Worked example

You lose **100 Interceptors** while defending, with a level 4 Repair Station, on Redline:
- Recovered share: **35%**, so **35 Interceptors**.
- Structure to repair: 35 × 4,000 = 140,000. Speed: 10 × 4 = 40 per second, so 3,500 seconds: about **58 minutes**.
- Had you lost only 2 Interceptors: 35% of 2 = 0.7, rounded down to **0**: nothing is recovered.

## Detailed data

| Level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recovered share (30% debris) | 31.5% | 33.6% | 34.3% | 35% | 35.7% | 36.4% | 37.1% | 37.1% | 37.8% | 37.8% |

Requirement: Orbital Dock 2. Level 1 cost: 200 metal, 50 hydrogen, 50 energy required.

## Common pitfalls

- **Only after a lost defense**: a failed attack triggers no repair.
- **Small losses bring nothing**: rounding is done per ship type.
- **Ships under repair do not defend you**: a new attack meanwhile finds a thinner orbit.
